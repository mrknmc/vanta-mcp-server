# Vanta MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/) server that provides access to Vanta's automated security compliance platform. Vanta helps organizations achieve and maintain compliance with security frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and others through automated monitoring, evidence collection, and continuous security testing. This MCP server enables AI assistants to interact with Vanta's API to retrieve compliance test results, manage security findings, and access framework requirements.

> **⚠️ Important Disclaimer:** This experimental server is currently in **public preview** and provides AI assistants with access to your Vanta compliance data. You may encounter bugs, errors or unexpected results. Always verify the accuracy and appropriateness of AI-generated responses before taking any compliance or security actions. Users are responsible for reviewing all outputs and ensuring they meet their organization's security and compliance requirements.

## Configuration

### Vanta OAuth Credentials

1. Create OAuth credentials from [Vanta's developer dashboard](https://developer.vanta.com/docs/api-access-setup)
2. Note your `client_id` and `client_secret` — you'll pass them as environment variables.

> **Note:** Vanta currently allows only a single active access_token per Application. [More info here](https://developer.vanta.com/docs/api-access-setup#authentication-and-token-retrieval)

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vanta": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "VANTA_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are unfamiliar with setting up MCP servers in Claude Desktop, [here is an example](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) in the official MCP documentation.

### Usage with Cursor

Add the server to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vanta": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "VANTA_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `VANTA_CLIENT_ID` (required): Your Vanta OAuth client ID
- `VANTA_CLIENT_SECRET` (required): Your Vanta OAuth client secret
- `VANTA_ENV_FILE` (alternative): Absolute path to a JSON file containing `client_id` and `client_secret` (legacy, takes lower priority than the env vars above)

## Installation

### NPX (Recommended)

```bash
npx @mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server
vanta-mcp-server
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server.git
cd vanta-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Build from Source

To build from source:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
2. Make the output executable
3. Place built files in the `build/` directory

Now you can configure Claude Desktop or Cursor to use the built executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vanta": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vanta-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "VANTA_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "VANTA_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

This server is built with TypeScript and includes the following development tools:

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **ESLint**: For code quality and consistency
- **Automated Tool Registry**: Zero-maintenance tool registration system
- **DRY Utilities**: Centralized utilities to reduce code duplication

### Architecture Highlights

- **Consolidated Tool Pattern**: Single tools intelligently handle both list and get operations with optional ID parameters
- **Reduced Complexity**: 43 tools (down from 53) through smart consolidation while maintaining full functionality
- **Clean Organization**: Operations files are cleanly separated from infrastructure code
- **Common Subdirectory**: All shared utilities, imports, and descriptions are organized in `operations/common/`
- **Automated Registry**: New tools are automatically discovered and registered without manual configuration
- **DRY Principles**: Extensive code reuse through centralized utilities and schema factories
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with comprehensive type definitions

For detailed architecture documentation, see [`src/operations/README.md`](src/operations/README.md).

## Debugging

You can use the MCP Inspector to debug the server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @mrknmc/vanta-mcp-server
```

The inspector will open in your browser, allowing you to test tool calls and inspect the server's behavior.

If you want to test a local build you can do so using:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node path/to/build/index.js
```

In the browser window you will then need to add the environment variables `VANTA_CLIENT_ID` and `VANTA_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Example Usage

### Get failing AWS tests for SOC2

```typescript
{
  "tool": "list_tests",
  "arguments": {
    "statusFilter": "NEEDS_ATTENTION",
    "integrationFilter": "aws",
    "frameworkFilter": "soc2",
    "pageSize": 50
  }
}
```
